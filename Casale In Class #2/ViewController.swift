The problem was that her occupation as a <occupation> did not fully support her. She came to the conclusion that switching occupations would not be an easy fix, and neither would moving out. She then came up with the bright idea of adopting a <dog breed> instead. Her and her brand new puppy named <name> lived happily ever after."
